# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the minimum version for GCC?

GCC 11. Hermes requires C++17 features that are only available since GCC 7.3. C++17 support is enabled by default in GCC 11; it can be explicitly selected in earlier versions with the `-std=c++17` command-line flag or `-std=gnu++17` to enable GNU extensions as well. See [C++17 Support in GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html#cxx17) for the details. Use `spack install gcc` first if your system has GCC 4. It will install GCC 12.2.0 by default. Then, run `spack compiler find` to use the newly installed gcc.

## Can I run Hermes on Mac?

No. macOS lacks several system calls that Hermes components use:

- fopen64 / fseeko64
- O_DIRECT / O_TMPFILE
- gethostbyname_r
- \_STAT_VER

## Does Hermes run on Linux only?

Yes. Hermes uses the fixed `/proc` code:

```cpp
inline std::string GetFilenameFromFD(int fd) {
  char proclnk[kMaxPathLen];
  char filename[kMaxPathLen];
  snprintf(proclnk, kMaxPathLen, "/proc/self/fd/%d", fd);
  size_t r = readlink(proclnk, filename, kMaxPathLen);
  filename[r] = '\0';
  return filename;
}
```

## Can I run Hermes on Chameleon JupyterLab Server?

Maybe. However, installation with Spack will fail due to timeout.
For older (< 0.8) Hermes, Google OR-Tools installation will fail.

## Why do I get `mercury->fatal` error when I use `rpc_protocol = "ofi+verbs";` in configuration file?

Such error occurs when `libfabric` is not compiled with `verbs` support. Try `spack install hermes ^libfabric fabrics=rxm,sockets,tcp,udp,verbs`.

## Why does MPI Adapter fail to compile?

The MPI-IO adapter only supports MPICH.
Use `spack install mpi ^mpich` to install mpi.
Load it with `spack load mpi`.
